# Honguitos


This is the final project of Valentina Delgado, for the full time bootcamp Data Analytics by Ironhack. 

## Objective: 
Using a dataset of 4,100 images of mushrooms, I will do image recognition and machine learning, in order to design a model that can tell me with high accurancy the type of mushroom we input to the model. 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcosvolpato/edible-and-poisonous-fungi

## Workplan: 

Organize the data (day 1-2):
- Turn the images into numbers using OpenCV, get a dataframe and labels that I can later use in my model. 

Find the right model (day 3 and 4):
- Use Neural Network, Random Forest and KNN, in order to find what is the best fit for the data. 

Test and evaluate(day 5):
- Get the highest accurancy, treat data if imbalanced, and test with new images. 

Create an iteractive platform for user (day 6 and 7):
- This is a nice to have, but create a basic webpage with a drop files option that can tell you the type of mushroom the user uploaded. 

Presentation day! (day 8):
- Present the process!
